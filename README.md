# Titanic_Data_Analysis_ML
This project explores a dataset on the Titanic's passengers using Python and its libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Additionally, the project includes a machine learning portion in which a basic model is developed to predict the survival outcomes of passengers from a test set.

The first portion of the project includes data exploration, cleansing and analysis of a training dataset (train.csv). In this portion, the following questions are addressed:
  
  1) Who were the passengers on the titanic?
  2) What deck were the passengers on, and how does that relate to their class?
  3) Where did the passengers embark from?
  4) Who was alone on the ship, and who was with family?
  5) What features (e.g., deck level) had an impact on a passenger's survival rate? Are there any discernable relationships or patterns?
  
The second half of the project will employ a basic linear regression ML model to predict which passengers survived the ships wreckage.
